# Interactive table of nuclides
I built this project for a physics presentation in high school to make explaining r- and s-processes much easier.

## How to use?
The webapp is hosted at https://neuklidkarte.web.app/#/. To see the actual data please download the csv file "nuclid_data.csv" from above and simply upload it on the webapp.

## Quick demo
![Alt text](<voll mit pfeilen.png>)

Using the slider on the top left you can control what nuclides are shown. The arrows display what process is responsible for creating the certain nuclides. By hovering over a nuclid you can see its name and other attributes on the bottom right.
